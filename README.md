# CO2-visualized
A script that automatically gathers and plots data regarding atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. Plots can be found [here](https://isaacdarling.com/2020/07/12/carbon-dioxide-levels/).

## Notes:
(I started the project circa July 2020, and edited it substantially circa April 2021)  
At the time I had just created my website, and I wanted to put something onto it (sadly I haven't had much time/vested interest in leaving more projects). I ended up automating a process that my dad had been doing manually for some time as a nice win-win. I later updated the code to better reflect my mastery of Python as well as to change small elements of the functionality.
